Our job as a team and as individuals is to work as a whole in creating the most advanced and complex robot possible, while striving for excellence and thinking intuitively, and solving problems in the STEM fields. The 2016 year was our rookie year and we tried our hardest to make our mark. Now with the 2017 season FIRSTÂ® STEAMWORKS on the way we are attempting to live up to last years greatness. With help from many mentors and other teams we think that we have what it takes to be the STEAMWORKS champions.
